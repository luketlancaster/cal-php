# Cal
A PHP Implementation of Cal, the Unix Command Line calendar program!


## Tests
Run the tests using `phpunit tests/{testname}.php`
The project is striving to follow TDD/Red Green Refactor, though it may get out of line at some point

## OOP
We'll be using mostly OOP, as this is close to the style of programming I'm using day to day


### TODO
Write out Year tests
More test cases for months (triple the amount, from different years too)
Refactor month: this was the first pass, could make it much cleaner probably
Don't think that the adding of Newlines is going to work great for year-ing, reconsider that
In cal.php work on the command line interface
