# Cal
A PHP Implementation of Cal, the Unix Command Line calendar program!


## Tests
Run the tests using `phpunit tests/{testname}.php`
The project is striving to follow TDD/Red Green Refactor, though it may get out of line at some point

## OOP
We'll be using mostly OOP, as this is close to the style of programming I'm using day to day
